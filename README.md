# CommonSpace
CommonSpace is a prototype built by Sidewalk Labs to explore how technology might enable the study of public life. It allows space managers and community groups to study activity in their public spaces in accordance with the Public Life Data Protocol. 

## About
CommonSpace was built by a small team of engineers and subject-matter experts at Sidewalk Labs, in consultation with the Gehl Institute and Park People. If you are interested in testing CommonSpace for your organization, reach out to commonspace@sidewalklabs.com.
